      <div class="about-me-description">
        <p>Want to know a little bit about me? Well, My name is Brandon and i'm 20 years old. As you can recognize by reading my age,
        I grew up in the digital age of the world. I got into technology at a very early age, and have been interested in it ever since.
        I remember using computers for as long as I can remember, but it wasn't until i got my first Apple iPod Touch at age 12,
        that I began to really get into technology, the internet, social media, and business. My iPod touch allowed me to have
        access to the interet whenever I had a wi-fi connection. So, being a nerdy "home-body" with a massive interest in so many
        things there were to access on the internet, I spent lots and lots of time on my iPod which eventually turned into an iPhone
        and I was just so happy to live in a time where I had access to so much information and so many opportunities. For a few years, I
        stopped being a book worm and began to become an online social butterfly and spent lots of time on my personal social media accounts as
        well as other fan pages I was growing to make become popular and influential. Around the time I turned 16, I became exhausted with
        social media and stopped using it in total for about 6 months. During the time I spent away from popular social networks, I realized I had
        been wasting too much time on social media not doing anything meaningful or beneficial to myself or others. I also became a lot more in
        touch with myself and what I really wanted to do; and found that I really wanted to pursure entrepreneurship. I spent a couple of years trying
        to start very small businesses that were really just side hustles. But, I was in high school so I figured trying anything was better than nothing
        and that i'd eventually figure it out. This led me to getting back on social media and growing pages large enough to provide me with a small extra income.
        I eventually got tired of starting mediocre side incomes that never seemed to last very long and I wanted to build something bigger,
        better, and more meaningful. I knew I would have to do learn lots of new things in order to be successful with an actual business,
        so I re-enforced my reading habits and started spendng lots of time learning about business and also picked up a lot of new skills. After reading lots of self-help
        and business startup books, I started to narrow my focus to learning marekting. Speicifically marketing for emails, the internet, and social media.
        I already had expereince in this, I knew online marketing was not only the future, but the now because of where everyone's eyes currently are on today,
        and I figured it'd be very valuable to learn these skills and become knowledgeable in this area as it could help me with any business idea I decided to pursure.
        When I turned 18 and graduated high school, I had already learned so much and I knew I had more knowledge than most entrepreneurs when they first start out.
        I started to feel like I wasn't doing enough with my knowledge and I figured it was time to try and start something real, so I did. It failed,
        but I learned a lot during the time I was trying to get it going. One thing I learned while building/editing the website for my business, was that I constantly wanted to do things
        to my website that I just didn't have the knowledge to do. I decided to start learning some basic programming and I just completely
        fell in love with it. When I started programming, it led me to my second large discovery in my failed business. It was that, in my previous
        years of trying to become an entrepreneur by starting small businesses/side hustles, I had always gone after things that I didn't
        truly beleive in and also wasn't very interested in. I kept aquiring knowledge on business and marketing, and had nothing to show for that
        knowledge, so I just tried to start anything that I could come up with. Which is actually not nearly as bad as I felt about it before, because I was just starting out and doing it
        helped me learn what I know now. I now view it as part of the learning experience that almost all of us must go through on this path. Once I started my programming journey,
        I realized I was actually very interested in it and it really just put me into a creative zone I felt was missing from myself since I was a child. The possibilities are endless
        when it comes to programming and technology innovation, and i'm a student of life, for life, so it doesn't bother me that I have to keep
        learning in order to keep up with technology. I actually enjoy it. These are just two of the many reasons why I started dedicating lots
        of time to coding. There's nothing I love more than coding and marketing. All I want to do is code and help businesses bring in new customers that
        will go on to become loyal ones. I want to help businesses transition to this digital era because it's very important and it's something I know well.
        And as you can see, these are the exact services that I offer in my consulting business. This was the road that led me to where I am today, and
        the whole reason why I started this in the first place. I hope this gave you insight to not only myself, but the meaning and drive behind my business and efforts. My
        mission is to help you and your business maximize your success and attract the right customers by establishing a strong online brand and showing customers through it
        the loyalty and meaningful message behind your company.

          <p>
            The largest interest I have in life would have to be technology and all of its advancements.
            I love technology because not only can it be used for extremely beneficial purposes, but it’s also just amazing to me what we humans have been able to come up with in a relatively very short time span.
            This huge interest is what got me into programming. It’s just great to be able to play a part in some of the foundational areas of what people are using with modern technology today.

          <p>
            Nearly everything about business and entrepreneurship is very interesting to me. Entrepreneurs are
            the brave leaders who go out and start something that serves the needs of other people. Lots of businesses
            are speical in their own way and there's nothing greater than to watch/be a part of one execute well
            and get their vision out the world so that we all understand it and recognize them for their uniqueness.

          <p>
            I have been very interested in books ever since my grandfather gave me a set of his encyclopedias when I was 4 years old. I would read for hours every night and now 16 years later I find myself doing the same exact thing.
            There is so much out there to learn and the more you read, the more you realize that and it keeps you reading. There’s also nothing quite like having your eyes stuck to the pages in a page turner about a fictional story or nonfiction historical events.

          </div>
          <p>
          I’ve found that writing/typing is a great way for me to express my thoughts and ideas, without always having to bother someone with them in person. Not only do I like copywriting or writing my ideas down, but I also like writing
          about subjects I have interest in because it helps me retain an even better understanding about the topic and sometimes leads to deeper questions I may have.

          </div>
          <p>
            I think music is great and that it works as a great tool for me. There’s music that helps me focus, relax, sleep, find motivation, etc. so, in a way, it serves many purposes and I am a huge fan because of that.
            Sometimes silence is the necessary or a better choice, but sometimes things go better when some tunes are playing.
            This is especially the case for me when programming or working out.

          </div>
          <p>
            I think almost all of us nerds have an interest in space. It’s the place of the unknown and the mother of our world that has limitless possibilities for what’s out there in it.
            It’s interesting when I think about how we’ve accomplished so much here in this planet, but we have no idea how it relates to others out there or anything that could be out there in that vast amount of space.
            Science in general is pretty interesting but when it comes to space, I’m very interested. It also looks really cool in photoshopped images and makes good use for background images.
